*A place for my C related stuff.*

I plan to put all my little projects here to keep track.

**List of current:**
* Fibonacci sequence
* Too High Too Low
* Read file as string (crap)
* Is Prime?
* Prime Calculator
* Add two numbers from user input

**List of inoperable**
These ones should not be looked at. They suck. And don't work.
* Convert string to array and preform function on all elements
